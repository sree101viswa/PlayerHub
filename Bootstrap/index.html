            The test case is defined as a group of conditions under which a tester determines whether a software application is working as per the customer's requirements or not. Test case designing includes preconditions, case name, input conditions, and expected result. A test case is a first level action and derived from test scenarios

        <div class="col-6 col-lg-2 text-centre"  >TTest case gives detailed information about testing strategy, testing process, preconditions, and expected output. These are executed during the testing process to check whether the software application is performing the task for that it was developed or not.
            Test case helps the tester in defect reporting by linking defect with test case ID. Detailed test case documentation works as a full proof guard for the testing team because if developer missed something, then it can be caught during execution of these full-proof test cases.
